# Weather-Reminder-App
This was my project was built for my ECE 4318 class in Fall 2019

The program allows for multiple users to set one or more custom weather notifications which can optionally be sent to the user via email, desktop popup, or both.
Weather data is pulled from OpenWeatherMap.org's weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, and displayed graphically to the user.
